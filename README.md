A simple neural network for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 
Trained using a custom model in NumPy (with Xavier initialization, biases, softmax activation, and cross-entropy loss) and deployed via a Tkinter GUI where users can draw digits. The predicted digit now appears directly in the window after pressing **Predict**.

TODO: improve accuarcy, its really bad at generalizing right now. Add more markdown cells to show thoughtprocess and so forth
