A simple neural network for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 
Trained using a custom model in NumPy (with Xavier initialization, biases, softmax activation, and cross-entropy loss) and deployed via a Tkinter GUI where users can draw digits.

you can access the MNIST dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset

TODO: improve accuarcy, its really bad at generalizing right now. Add more markdown cells to show thoughtprocess and so forth, switch sigmoid to ReLU maybe?
